#+TITLE: Wasmer/Rust example

A self-educational project that I'm using to learn how to program in Rust for WASI-compatible runtimes (wasmer in particular).

* Prerequisites

To build and run this project you'll need to

- Get nightly ~rustc~ with ~wasm32-wasi~ toolchain:
#+BEGIN_SRC
$ rustup target add wasm32-wasi --toolchain nightly
#+END_SRC
- Install [[https://wasmer.io/][wasmer]]

* Building & running

Just use `make run`

#+BEGIN_SRC text
$ make run
Hello, World!
#+END_SRC
